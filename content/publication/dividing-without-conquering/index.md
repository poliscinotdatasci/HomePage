abstract: Based on the literature about the role of rising nationalism in recent
  world politics, this paper proposes a nationalism-oriented causal model to
  explain the voting choices of different social groups. With an
  interest-identity framework, this generic model is applied to Taiwan’s 2016
  presidential election to examine whether and to what extent 11 causal
  mechanisms influence the voting choices of four groups defined by generation,
  class, and ethnicity. The findings not only reveal generational, class-based,
  and ethnic differences in Taiwanese voting behavior; they also show that the
  election was largely one of identity politics centered around the issues of
  national identity and democratic identification, making the “interest card”
  played by Beijing less effective in swaying voter choices. This explains why
  Beijing’s divide-and-conquer economic policy successfully divided Taiwanese
  voters but failed in the end to prevent the pro-independence candidate from
  winning the election. The findings also indicate that the economic concerns of
  voters promoted both their Taiwanese identity and support for Taiwan
  independence, while identification with Taiwan’s democracy contributed
  directly to the former and only indirectly to the latter. Overall, the model
  presents a more fine-grained analysis of nationalist politics and may be
  applied to the studies of other political behaviors involving nationalism.

abstract: Based on a nine-city cell phone survey in 2019, this paper
  systematically examines which groups showed stronger support for armed
  unification with Taiwan and what factors and mechanisms might contribute to
  their support. The bivariate analysis shows the politically, economically, and
  socially privileged groups and those with stronger national pride and more
  understanding of Taiwan were more pro-armed unification, while residents of
  the two coastal cities, Xiamen and Guangzhou, were less supportive. Further
  analysis indicates education and unfavorable view of the Taiwanese government
  were the two most powerful factors contributing to the support. Possible
  contributing mechanisms might include both top-down mechanisms, such as
  political indoctrination and propaganda, and bottom-up ones, such as the
  respondents’ interest and identity considerations influenced by their city’s
  proximity to Taiwan.
